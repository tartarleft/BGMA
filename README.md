# Background Music Attack
Demos and PyTorch implementation of Background Music Attack (BGMA) in our paper ["Fooling Speaker Identification Systems with Adversarial Background Music"](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2020/abstracts/1275.html) (INTERSPEECH 2023).

##Demos of Adversarial Music

Follwing are the adversarial generated by BGMA:

### Pretrained Models

We provide the [pretrained SI models](https://github.com/tartarleft/BGMA) and [pretrained music model](https://github.com/tartarleft/BGMA) one can download and save to the ckpt of project file.
