# Background Music Attack
Demos and PyTorch implementation(The code will be released sooner) of Background Music Attack (BGMA) in our paper ["Fooling Speaker Identification Systems with Adversarial Background Music"](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2020/abstracts/1275.html) (INTERSPEECH 2023).

## Prerequisites
* Python (3.6.9)
* Pytorch (1.2.0)
* SoundFile (0.10.3)
* librosa (0.8.1)
* CUDA
* numpy


## Demos of Adversarial Music
### The following are the adversarial music generated by the migration of PGD. There are two examples for each target model: X-vector, D-TDNN, and ECAPA. The targeted model is indicated by the file name.

### The following are the adversarial music generated by BGMA, which is more auditorily natrual with less white-noise-like sound in the music.
